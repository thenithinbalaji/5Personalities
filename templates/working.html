            The classification is done based on Multinomial Logistic Regression.

            Whenever a user takes up the test, the input is given to the ML model and the model predicts the
            personality trait of the user.

            <b>What is Multinomial Logistic Regression?</b> <br>
            Multinomial Logistic Regression is a classification technique that extends the logistic regression algorithm
            to solve multiclass possible outcome problems, given one or more independent variables.

            This model is used to predict the probabilities of categorically dependent variable, which has two or more
            possible outcome classes. Whereas the logistic regression model is used when the dependent categorical
            variable has two outcome classes for example, students can either “Pass” or “Fail” in an exam or bank
            manager can either “Grant” or “Reject” the loan for a person.
